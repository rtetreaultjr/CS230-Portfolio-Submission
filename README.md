# CS230-Portfolio-Submission

The Gaming Room client wanted a platform that could make their game, “Draw it or Lose it,” more able to reach a large audience. To do so, they were looking for a recommendation on an operating platform that could run their game. During the development of the documentation for the client, one thing I felt I did particularly well with was designing and describing the UML for a singleton program. My understanding was particularly strong in that area in knowing specifically what would be helpful in designing the software. Having the UML diagram completed really helped in understanding the different classes and their uses for the final program.
If there was one thing I would like to revise, it would be the comparison between the operating systems. I feel like I have a much better understanding of their strengths and weaknesses then when I completed that section, and I would have much better input. By understanding the user’s needs, I was better able to focus the design document to what they required in a platform that would minimize required memory and be able to run multiple games with no duplicates. Using a UML diagram was incredibly helpful in developing code, and is definitely something I will be using in future assignments where I need to solve a problem with software design. Planning is always important when developing and learning some of the tools that can be used to map out software will be useful in my future endeavors.
